# employee-tracker

## Description 

The motivation building the employee tracker was to create a practical and efficient tool to organize and plan a company's structure.

This application solves the problem of manual data management and organization for business owners. By leveraging Node.js, Inquirer, and MySQL, the application provides a streamlined and user-friendly interface for interacting with the employee database. It allowsyou to view, add, update, and organize information about departments, roles, and employees, enhancing their ability to plan and make informed decisions about their company's structure and workforce.

Through this project, I learned the intricacies of building a command-line application using Node.js, handling user input with Inquirer, and integrating a MySQL database for data storage. I gained valuable insights into structuring and managing database queries, ensuring data integrity, and providing an intuitive user experience through the command line. Additionally, this project highlighted the importance of developing tools that cater to the specific needs of businesses, showcasing the practical applications of technology in enhancing organizational efficiency and decision-making. Overall, it deepened my understanding of full-stack development and the significance of creating solutions that bridge the gap between technical and non-technical stakeholders.
